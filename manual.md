# Vitamin Junkies Guide to Pharmaceuticals
*An informational guide on how to make it in the alternative medicines by "Dr" Aldon Illson*

---

In this **current year** the trust people have for pharmaceutical companies is at an all time low
and so it is crucial that the field of alternative medicine picks up the pace and creates remedies
to suit the needs of society. Unfortunately, actually studying medicine and even herbal therapy courses

a single online guide.

## The Software

Get VitaSys, it's like $400 usually but it's the internet so just pirate the source code [here](https://github.com/pielegacy/VitaminUnderscore) and build 
it yourself. This is gonna be a big ask but install the .NET Core framework and execute `dotnet run` in its folder. That should be heaps enough for you to
get Vitamin development going.
